===================
Core ADO.NET Concepts
üîóADO.NET is the core technology in .NET framework for database communication, providing classes to interact with various databases using specific providers like SQLClient for SQL Server and OleDb for Access.

üèóÔ∏èADO.NET offers two architectures: connected (establishes database connection for SQL operations) and disconnected (loads data into local objects for manipulation).

Data Handling Mechanisms
üìäDataSets, used in disconnected architecture, store data locally on the client machine, enabling manipulation and closure of the database connection.

üîçDataReaders are efficient for reading small amounts of data, while DataAdapters load all data into a DataSet for local manipulation.

Practical Application
üíªImplementing ADO.NET requires knowledge of C# and T-SQL programming languages, with tutorials available for those lacking sufficient understanding of these technologies.

Video-2: ADO.NET - Environment Setup
========
Title: ADO.NET - Setting Up Environment: Downloading and Installing SQL Server 2014 Express

Environment Setup for ADO.NET requires Visual Studio and SQL Server.
- Download and install Microsoft SQL Server 2014 Express
- Choose the required language and version, and complete the installation process.

Setting up ADO.NET requires downloading and installing the required components.
- Choose the appropriate version of the management studio based on your operating system (64-bit or 32-bit).
- Proceed with the downloading and installation process for accessing the database.

 Video Title: Understanding DataSet in ADO.NET - Tutorialspoint

Data sets allow storing and accessing multiple data tables
- Data sets act as a database with disconnected architecture
- Data tables can be created manually or from database communication using the data adapter class

Populate data set from data adapters
- Data adapter fills data in data set in the form of data table
- Establish relationships between tables for referential integrity

Data set allows storing multiple tables with disconnected architecture.
- Data set manages relationships and can store multiple tables.
- Methods like getEmployTable and data table creation are used in examples.

Adding tables to a DataSet and sequence importance
- Created a method to generate DataSet and added employ and department tables
- Sequence of adding tables to DataSet is important

Data tables can be accessed from DataSet by name or index
- Tables in DataSet can be accessed by name or index, providing flexibility
- Relationships can be established using primary key-foreign key relationship

Accessing columns in a DataSet
- Columns can be accessed either by name or index
- DataRelation class can be used for column retrieval

Initializing a relationship in ADO.NET using DataSet constructor
- Pass three parameters: name of relationship, primary key column name, and foreign key column name
- Maintain the relationship using DataRelation and return the DataSet

Using DataSet in disconnected architecture
- DataGridview used with different data sources
- Ability to assign tables by name or index

Short Summary for [ADO.NET - Serializing DataSet]

 Title: Serializing DataSet into JSON and XML in ADO.NET Tutorial

- Serializing dataset objects helps retain data between application executions

- Data retrieval process in web application

- Serializing DataSet data in XML and JSON format

- Serializing DataSet to XML format in ADO.NET

- Serialize DataSet to get all data in JSON format

- Serialize DataTable to JSON using Json.NET

- Using Streamwriter for writing a JSON file

- JSON format stores data in attribute-value pairs inside curly braces and square brackets.

Detailed Summary for [ADO.NET - Serializing DataSet](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MolUlHt3I6Y) by [Merlin](https://merlin.foyer.work/)

 Title: Serializing DataSet into JSON and XML in ADO.NET Tutorial

Serializing dataset objects helps retain data between application executions
- Serializing dataset objects allows data to be stored in the application server instead of the database server, reducing the need to establish connections with the database for data retrieval
- This is beneficial when the data is not updated frequently and helps in avoiding the complete cycle of data retrieval from the database

Data retrieval process in web application
- Requests go to the web server and then to the database server
- Data with low frequency of updation can be stored in the web server

Serializing DataSet data in XML and JSON format
- Data in DataSet can be written to XML or JSON format.
- XML is the older way to write data and has methods for writing data in XML format.

Serializing DataSet to XML format in ADO.NET
- Describing how to serialize a DataSet to XML format using the data table
- Illustrating the process of creating an XML file with the records from the data table

Serialize DataSet to get all data in JSON format
- Use ADO.NET to open and retrieve data from a data table
- Configure Newtonsoft.Json to write the data table in JSON format

Serialize DataTable to JSON using Json.NET
- Newtonsoft.Json library needs to be installed to work with JSON serialization
- Use JsonConvert.SerializeObject method to convert DataTable to JSON string

Using Streamwriter for writing a JSON file
- Streamwriter is used to create a text file with a different extension
- The JSON string is written to the file and the file is then closed to save the data

JSON format stores data in attribute-value pairs inside curly braces and square brackets.
- Attributes and values are separated by a comma.
- Data can be serialized in JSON format for easy transfer to application or web servers.
