===================
Core ADO.NET Concepts
üîóADO.NET is the core technology in .NET framework for database communication, providing classes to interact with various databases using specific providers like SQLClient for SQL Server and OleDb for Access.

üèóÔ∏èADO.NET offers two architectures: connected (establishes database connection for SQL operations) and disconnected (loads data into local objects for manipulation).

Data Handling Mechanisms
üìäDataSets, used in disconnected architecture, store data locally on the client machine, enabling manipulation and closure of the database connection.

üîçDataReaders are efficient for reading small amounts of data, while DataAdapters load all data into a DataSet for local manipulation.

Practical Application
üíªImplementing ADO.NET requires knowledge of C# and T-SQL programming languages, with tutorials available for those lacking sufficient understanding of these technologies.
